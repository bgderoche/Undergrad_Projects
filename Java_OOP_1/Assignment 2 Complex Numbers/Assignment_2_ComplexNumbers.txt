ASSIGNMENT 2: COMPLEX NUMBERS

Write a class that defines an object for a complex number. 
Your class will have a constructor that accpets two floats
as input arguments. The two floats will represent the a and
b parts of the complex number. 

Write a tester program to test your complex number class. It
will be a class with a single main method in it. In that main
method, you will create complex number objects, add, subtract,
multiply, and divide them, printing what you are doing and the
results as you do it.
