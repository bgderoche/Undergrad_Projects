ASSIGNMENT: Create a n-sided Die

Write a class to model a n-sided die. The die will have two properties:
	1. The number of sides of the die
	2. The value of the last roll of the die
For example, the die could have 6 sides, and after the die is rolled that 
value will be saved in an instance variable for the last roll. The constructor
will accept a parameter specifying the number of sides. There will be a command
to roll the die, a query to return the value last rolled, and a toString query 
to print the state of the die. 

When you roll the die, I want the roll to be "random." To generate a pseudo-random
number between 0-9, see the following code:

	import java.util.Random;
	
	...

	Random gen = new Random();
	int number = gen.nextInt(10);
